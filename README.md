TUMI - Tutoring Machine Interface
TUMI is a AI Agent which monitors and guide you trough your educational proccess.
It's not a tutor, it is your personal guide trough your educational process.
TUMI includes the following:
- A Educational Profile Website + App
  It will extract information from the educational pages, give reports and send alerts
  of classes, exams, groups works and homework. Will analyze you to make you excellent.
- A Personal Robot
  As well as we know, the information which will be extracted from the educational
  pages are PARTIALLY OBSERVABLE. We will need a robot so it can track your behavior
  in order to understand the results better and adapt the educational proccess so
  you can improve. This will make the environment almost FULLY OBSERVABLE.

  The educational process is STOCHASTIC, so we will definitly identify your goals, make the best path and guide you trough it! So we wil make it DETERMINISTIC.
  We consider education proccess can become an ADVERSARIAL environment and take your lots of time without the proper guidance. We will make it BENIGN.
  Why are applying AI, to manage the uncertain educational process.

As a matter of learning this respository will contain all the Machine learning +
Artificial intelligence projects of Coursera, Udacity and so forth.

Enjoy TUMI
